Aly is a statically typed, whitespace-agnostic programming language built from scratch in C. Designed for simplicity and clarity, Aly is easy to read, easy to write, and built for programmers of all levels. The compiler targets x86_64 GNU AT&amp;T assembly and is developed without third-party libraries using C and CMake.
